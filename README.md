# Kaggle - The-5 Day Data Challenge
This repo contains the Python 3 code for Kaggle's The 5-Day Data Challenge which was originally ran from October 23, 2017 to October 27, 2017. I've completed the challenge and presented my analysis in the Jupyter Notebook here. Feel free to clone this repo and go through the challenge if you missed it.
